After plugging it in, the hardware was instantly recognized and drivers were installed. I was ready to go in under a minute.

I read somewhere here that the USB cable was extremely short but I don't think so. I just measured it and - excluding plugs - it is 24 inches. Of course if you are looking to plug this into the back of your computer and have it reside on your desk, it might be too short if the CPU is sitting under your desk. I am using it with a desktop USB hub and have plenty of cable to spare.

Another plus: It actually works without having to be plugged into the CPU directly, i.e. it operates fine via the hub.

The only thing I don't like all that much: the USB cable is non-removable and permanently connected to the drive, making it take up more room when taking it on the road than it would need if I could store the cable separately from the drive itself.

They used to ship their own, in stock, products; but now they contract with so many other ""resellers"" that the quality control has gone into the toilet.  I received this external floppy drive today and upon opening the package saw that the container box was partly open.  Opening it the rest of the way showed me a floppy drive laying on top of the plastic bag it was supposed to be inside, and fingerprints all over it.  I thought ""obviously a return.""  But then I looked in the drive opening and there was a floppy disc inside with someone's personal files labeled on it.  For sure a return.  You would think these screwballs at The Surplus Joint would at least have checked the drive before sending it back out, and maybe testing it???

So, I cleaned up the recycled floppy drive and decided to give it a try to read some of my old floppy's.  Guess what?  It didn't work, and you have to ask yourself, Why did someone return it?  Because it either didn't work, or they broke it and wanted to screw someone else by getting their money back.  So, it's $20 in the toilet, not worth my time to send it back.  I will never do business with The Surplus Joint through Amazon ever again, and I am starting to question if my money is best spent through the continuation of my extensive purchasing from Amazon.  This is not my first bad experience with an Amazon reseller.  I think I would have had better luck dealing with Ebay or Craig's list.

I went ahead and said ok, waited several minutes, then it showed a format fail. At this point I picked up the unit to plug it into a USB 3.0 port and noticed that the entire case was split apart. I snapped it back together and plugged it into my USB 3.0. It seemed to like this better and ran a little more quiet however, it doesn't work very well. It doesn't seem to know it has a disk half the time. The other half, it wants to format. At this point, I've gotten 1 .pdf file to copy but it was hardly plug-and-play.

Unfortunately, it reads and writes ONLY 1.44MB high density disks which was disappointing since I still have some 720k double density disks I was hoping to read. And while it is faster than a standard internal floppy drive, it doesn't seem as fast as the Teac was. But considering the format is dying (ok...dead) I was happy to find one of these at all.

It is primarily used on a Windows 7 PC to make disks for an old Pentium Windows 3.1/DOS 6.22 system, which reads the disks just fine. It was literally a plug and play installation.

Quick tip for anyone looking to read very old MS Word files from old floppies (in my case circa 1990, originally created with MS Word on a PC):
1) Launch MS Word, and select ""Open"" from the file menu.
2) At the bottom of the Open screen, select ""Recover text from any file"" from the ""Enable"" drop-down menu
3) Select the old Word file you want to open

The drive made loud grinding noises on the disk, and wouldn't stop, but no icon appeared on the desktop. Then put it on a Dell Windows XP laptop I had, and it worked fine--well, almost. When I tried to Quick Format a disk, it said the disk was write protected (which it wasn't), but I put in a different disk, then re-inserted the first one, and it formatted it. I hadn't bothered to install the Windows drivers that came with the unit; by the way, there are no drivers necessary for Max OS X, and, apparently, not for Windows XP either. Took the drive back to the Mac and tried plugging it in to the LEFT side USB port, and suddenly it worked fine. Tried the RIGHT side port again, no luck. First time I've seen something like this.

Also, there is NOTHING on the unit with the name ""Sabrent"" that I could find.  I wondered if I actually got what I'd ordered.

We have an Acer 17-inch laptop with Vista Home Premium (which we hate -- the Vista OS) and were very reluctant to purchase the floppy drive unit as we have had untold and constant compatibility problems with Vista.

However we have an older Sony digital camera which we still use a great deal and it uses the floppy disks as memory. We also have an older Dell Latitude laptop with the A-drive which we were using to process photos, however it was sent in for repairs and in the meantime, our disks were piling up as we take a lot of photos. We had also previously considered getting a floppy disk drive for the Acer as we transfer our photos from the Dell to the Acer anyway in a less than time-efficient manner. But again, finding something compatible with the Vista OS was a major concern.

We wrote to thinkpads-r-us and Nancy got back to us within the day, assuring us the floppy drive would work with our laptop and operating system, even telling us that the drive unit did have an IBM logo on it nonetheless -- so we went ahead and ordered it.

It was here two days later. We shut the laptop down, plugged the unit in, booted the laptop back up -- and held our breath. Then we saw a small box open at the bottom of the screen, saying the computer recognized ""new hardware"" -- then a few seconds later another box saying it was installing the same. One to two minutes later, a third box said it was installed and ready to use! We were OVERJOYED!

Yes, the floppy drives are old-fashioned, yes even with our Acer with mega-super RAM, they are a little slow. They make a little noise, nothing like indicated in any of the reviews however. But it works with VISTA and we are EXTREMELY HAPPY!

Picked it up and noticed that it rattled around inside. Sounded like something was loose. Plugged it in to my Mac again, and voila! I heard the floppy being accessed and it showed up on my desktop. I looked at the files and it seemed to work. The drive was actually recognized by my Mac as a Teac drive. Ejected the disk on the desktop and the drive icon disappeared from my desktop.

I went through the whole procedure of unplugging and plugging it into the USB several dozen more times and never got it to work again. Packed it up and sending it back.

447,1.0,"11 8, 2012",A4OXSQLCWYDFK,B000M3GODW,"The split is about 50/50 for this Floppy drive to work, and I wasn't lucky.
The first thing to do on any Hardware addition is to check the BIOS.  I couldn't even do that because the drive Froze the BIOS. (New Asus, Intel i7 motherboard).  I tried over and over about 9 times when I finally got into the BIOS and the BIOS can't see the Floppy Drive.  RULE: When the BIOS has problems, then your OS (in my case XP pro)will also have problems.  And so it did, when I attached the Floppy drive, Windows froze.

Which all leads to 2 specific items:  (1) There is absolutely no quality control before they ship this product, and (2) there is no testing of this product before shipment.

Some people here complain that there was no driver in the package. Well, you don't need a driver, Windows will load a driver for you automatically.  The disk included within this package only applies to a Computer with a MAC or a DOS OS.  If this Floppy drive were seen in the BIOS, Windows would have loaded all the necessary drivers and assigned a drive letter.  I don't know if a useless product deserves 1 Star, and if there were a -0- Star I would have given that.  For one, I've build computers since 1963 when you haven't heard of the word computers and never seen a simple Floppy drive be so useless.

For those that need a Floppy drive to load and repair Windows (other than Vista & Win 7) in order to use the F6 Key, may I suggest you slipstream the required drivers, [such for SATA Drives, SIL for IDE drives, and NEC for USB 3 ][and allow you to enter the ""Recovery Console"" for such things as FIXBOOT, and FIXMBR, (when you have a NTLDR not found BSOD, into your present Windows CD (then burn a new CD)  Use nLite to slipstream and follow directions, it will even burn for you.

Maybe I should pay more attention to the dates that they were written, but for the middle of 2011 I was surprised to be able to find a floppy drive at all.  Even more surprised at how difficult it was to find diskettes.  The kid at the local office supply actually asked me what a floppy drive was.

That said, the drive arrived as expected in a brown envelope and a simple brown box.  It connected via USB and was immediately recognized - without requiring any secondary drivers (which are not included, anyway.)  It's not quiet, but as an emergency for old systems it's perfect and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",teac 1.44mb usb external floppy disk drive (black),Teac

I've had drawers full of old floppy disks, and I was too lazy to archive the contents off before my last PC with a disk drive died.  I knew that there were many important files on these, so when I saw this drive on Amazon for under $20, I thought I would take a chance.  Here are my thoughts:

1. Yep, the drive is generic.  Looks like someone made a cheap drive, slapped a (crooked) Teac sticker on it, and called it a name brand drive
2. Drive is pretty noisy, but that may be my memory forgetting how noisy the old internal floppy drives were.  It could also reflect the cheap build.
3. Cable is fairly short, about 2 feet, so I had to place this on top of my desktop.  Another aspect of the cheap build, I guess.
4. In spite of how cheap it feels, it worked like a champ.  I went through 500+ disks, and it pulled everything off the disks without a problem.
5. I knew that several disks had deleted files that I wanted to see if I could retrieve.  This was the only place the drive failed me.  The scan for the files was fine.  However, although the drive allowed me to find the deleted files, it would not allow me to recover them.  An otherwise perfect drive lost one star for that.

I have loaned the drive out to several friends, and none have had an issue with using the drive.  Works fine with XP and Vista. I have not hooked it up to my Win7 machines, so I can't tell if it works or not.

499,1.0,"05 18, 2011",A2P0J63XX5P4S6,B000M3GODW,"This drive isn't exactly the life changing innovation the advertisement leads one to believe it is.

Some similar drives might, however, fit the bill. Here's the program, as far as I can figure it out:
Several drives in similar enclosures are available from many off-shore manufacturers, with many brand names. Most have the same model number. It appears that this drive is an OEM drive, built by whomever with any drive, case & chipset that prices well on any given day.
Some combinations might work out very well, some not so much.

This drive is advertised as Teac. In reality, it is a mystery-brand case, an unknown chipset and a NEC drive inside (so the computer tells me). When you see other drives similar to this one, it is a throw of the dice as to which drive is inside and which chipset runs the gizmo. They are usually OEM style- Some are branded, such as IBM.

Here are my experiences with this particular unit:

THE GOOD-
A) The case seems very sturdy and - to my eyes- nice looking.
B) My wimpy USB port on my MacBook Pro (500mW) has no trouble spinning the drive.
C) It is really funny to read the pamphlet that comes with the drive. The translations are creative. For example the title is
  ""Roarable Disk Drive"" or something like that.
D) Windows XP found a driver for it on its own, but there are quirks- See crabby complaint item ""I"" below
E) Mac OS X needed no driver, but it won't read older Mac floppies. I don't remember the specification that it can't read.
  Sorry about that. I was being very selfish and didn't write it down so you all would know. How Rude of Me!

THE BAD-
A) It does not, not, not come with a driver disk. So, if you are planning on using it for Windows 98 or 98SE you are totally out of luck.
  Same for old MAC operating systems. Sorry!
  There are several 'brands' of this drive on the market, so I downloaded, literally, 41 drivers from the internet for the 'same'
  drive. None worked because this is a NEC drive with an unknown chipset. (Apparently an odd combination)
  Your purchase might deliver a drive where a driver is readily available. Who knows?
B) The seller is not able to be contacted for a driver download link or any other issue. No way No How
C) When you get the drive, it will say it includes a case on the box. Wow! A free surprise. No case is inside, sorry. (It lies about the
  driver disk, too) In fairness to the seller- the ad doesn't say it has a case. Probably just a cheap Gucci bag anyway.
D) It quit working after reading two or three disks. It would whir & clunk & make the fingernail-on-the-blackboard sound- then repeat.
  Ejecting it, unplugging it, re-booting & starting over allowed it to read a few more; then the circus act would start all over again.
E) It couldn't write any disk in any OS. Not one line, no matter the brand of floppy. Would not change an existing file.
  Yeah, I remember that the floppies need to be un-locked. This thing pretends to write. The stuff just doesn't show up. Neat Trick!
F) MS-DOS 6.22 looks at the drive and says ""Oh, Heck No! Get that thing away from me!"" <A Mitsumi I bought to replace this one works
  fine in MS Dos.>
G) The USB cord is super short. If your tower is under the desk, you need an extension. (The ad does mention the length)
H) Don't even think about using a hub. Scary stuff happens no matter the OS. I had a disk in the drive, in Windows XP. The drive was into
  a hub. I plugged in a thumb drive & the drive spun like crazy. I couldn't stop it, so I had to force XP to shut down to get things
  under control. I tried it all again- Same excitement. The floppy was rendered ""un-readable"". I was rendered un-cheerful.
I) Windows XP constantly asks for the disk to be formatted- Even if no disk is in the drive. Ignore it & you can work normally, but it is
  kind of aggravating. OK, really aggravating! But, using XP-Pro under Parallels as a virtual OS, it won't do this. Why? I dunno!
J) The disk launches out of the drive when you push the button. I'm talking wave to the space shuttle distances.
K) Storing the drive on the ""Shelf Of Treasures"" is not so easy, as the USB cord is permanent. It sticks out the back & causes
  everything else on the shelf to get whacked & knocked around. This is a trivial complaint, but it threw the whole feng shui of
  my office off kilter. Qi was off- way off.

THE PRETTY-
I wrote to Amazon, explaining that it did not meet the advertisement of Teac Brand & was useless due to no driver disk. I also explained that the seller was missing in action, so I could not resolve it with them.
No problem: Amazon jumped right in & sent me a return label to send it back, credited my charge card & offered free shipping if I wanted a replacement from the same seller. (I declined that part.)
Amazon was amazingly responsive to this situation. I'm impressed. The whole return process took less than 1/2 day. Cool, Huh?

SO NOW WHAT?
I returned it, courtesy of Amazon. From a competitor, I bought a Mitsumi OEM style- with the driver disk- for the same amount of money. It works fine in all situations. This tells me the problems were not caused by the computer or 'user error', as is often the case with me & computer stuff.

WHY THE LOW STARS WHEN OTHERS GIVE IT GOOD REVIEWS? WHAT AM I- A BIG OLD MEANNY OR SOMETHING?
In the description, it says PC & Mac compatible. That implies it works with PC and MAC- not ""Some PC & Some MAC"".
It would be more accurate if it said ""Kinda-Sorta PC & Mac Compatible"" or, they could have said something like: ""Unless you need a driver for Windows 98 or Mac before 10.4- then shop elsewhere 'cause you ain't getting one from us""

I also low-starred it because it was not the advertised brand (Teac). Had it been Teac for real, I could have downloaded the driver quite easily from Teac's site and maybe life would have been good, with Yin & Yang all hugged up tight.  As far as it not writing & the cool noises, this may have simply been a defective unit. Stuff happens. I'd have been good with a simple exchange. But No ...

The real star smusher was the seller's lack of response to the problem. Had I had the driver (or even some indication the seller cared about getting it to me), I would have exchanged it & probably been oh so happy. But, frustrated after trying 41 drivers (even several from Teac) and the grindy-crunchy thing, capped off by no contact from the seller- a divorce was the only humane solution.",teac 1.44mb usb external floppy disk drive (black),Teac

At first it looked like this would work because for many disks--but NOT ALL--it was able to display the content directory.  However, I was not able to copy any of the the files on the 8 disks I sampled.  So, is this the drive or the old diskettes?  I was able to write a small file to the disk (1KB).  I then attempted to format a diskette to see if I the drive would work with fresh tracks.  No luck with either Quick or full formatting.  I tried 9 different diskettes.  Nothing worked.

I was not able to recover the file I wanted--the reason I bought this in the first place.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that there still is the chance that all the old diskettes I tried are bad.  More likely, the diskettes are deteriorated and this reader is not made well enough to work with anything marginal.

617,2.0,"03 20, 2013",A3LDMYEU5ZPKAM,B001MT3FMI,"I read the mixed reviews for this SABRENT USB FLOPPY DISK DRIVE, but I decided to try it anyway. There really didn't seem to be many to chose from. As explained below, my experience was NOT good and I cannot recommend this external drive for 3.5"" floppy disks.

First, the drive installed fine on two different computers. I just plugged it into the USB port on my Win 7 Pro (64-bit) Dell Vostro and it installed without a hitch. It also installed fine on my older Win XP Pro Gateway. I didn't need any drivers for either install. I just plugged in the drive to the USB port -- true plug and play on both machines. The box claims compatibility with Win XP, Win Vista, Win 7 and Mac OS X. The documentation in the box does NOT mention Win 7, but it does mention older PC and Mac systems: preinstalled Win 98, Win 2000 Professional, Win Me, or Win XP; Power Mac G4, G4 Cube, iMac, iBook, powerBook G4, preinstalled Mac OS 8.6, Mac OS 9 or later, Mac OS X 10.1 or later.

I bought the SABRENT disk drive because my Win 7 computer doesn't have an ""A"" drive and I had to transfer an old program (which uses a software ""security key"" for copy protection) from my old Win XP computer to my Win 7 computer and to do this I had to use a specific 3.5"" disk to prove that I have license for the program running on the hard drive. (If you don't remember ""security keys"", they were a software approach to ""copy protection"" which annoyed honest people who paid for the software, but (the people) weren't ""geeky"" enough to get around it.) I mention this because the 3.5"" disk I needed to read is old (from 2002), which may have been the reason I had problems with the drive.

After I installed the SABRENT disk drive (on my Win 7 computer), I was able to read several different 3.5"" disks, but a few disks weren't readable -- okay, that could be because the 3.5"" disks were years old, but aren't most of them old in 2013??? (The disks were NOT copy protected, I checked.) I do know that the SABRENT disk drive was able to read the 3.5"" disk with the security key on it, but IT ONLY READ IT ONCE and never again. After it read the disk with the security key on it, I couldn't read that disk in any other machine, so that's when I installed this external disk drive to my Win XP machine. I figured, if the SABRENT drive could read the disk when connected to my Win 7 computer, it should read it again when connected to my Win XP computer. Nope. After it failed to read the disk, I tried reading the disk on three other machines with a built-in A drive (and Win XP Pro) and not one could read the disk. No matter what I did, the SABRENT disk drive would not read the security key disk again.

I slid back the slider on the disk and it looked like the brown media had been scraped off in a circle -- I could see through it. I'm not knowledgable enough to conclude if it was the drive or the disk that caused the problem. (No wonder no drive could read the disk, the media had ""flaked off"".) In any case, this drive was not a success for me, but it could have been my disk (???), so I gave it 2 stars -- and wanted you to know why.

This drive looked like the answer to my needs.  However, I have encountered several problems with this drive on both XP and Win 7 PC's.  For example, 1) on a Win 7 Pro machine, a diskette with data confirmed on my old XP machine with floppy drive will not open and returns a message the diskette needs to be formatted.  2) Try to format the diskette, and returns a message that it can format the diskette.  3) Floppy drive hangs, seems to occur after trying to access a 2nd diskette.  4) Fails to be recognized, and returns message A:\ is not accessible ...  The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error.  5) Floppy drive hangs, locksup XP PC, have to reboot.  Bought this drive in Jul 2011, for occasional use.

Shipping was quite fast and Amazon's return policy is the greatest - the latter definitely came in handy regarding this item. The product description is quite accurate- it's described as a 1.44MB drive, but unlike most 1.44MB drives this one will only recognize, and therefore only read, high density disks, so if you're interested in accessing ""legacy-type"" files on the older disks, it doesn't work. If a vendor provided a high-quality product that would read both, buyers would be willing to spend more just so that they could read these older disks well as the high-density disks.

My heart sank when I saw it was in the same packaging as the other, the same labeling, only the name was different.  Worth a try, right?

I am confident that there is no way to do it!
An external USB drive is the only option available, if you need to access floppy discs.

It is nowhere as usable as an internal drive.
The PC will stop recognizing it.
Unplugging it and replugging it in will usually solve the problem.
Sometimes a reboot will be necessary.

It was amazing the things I found on those old floppies!  I have a new hobby now, transcribing the info for ""historical"" purposes!

There was a ""trick"" though, when using it on a Windows 7 machine.  It said ""just plug it in and it will work"".  Plugged it in, opened up Windows Explorer - not there!  Hmmm...  Started searching the internet and found that a lot of people were having this problem with this device on WIN7.  Hmmm...  Then, almost by accident, I stumbled on the answer.  To get it going, it has to read a disk.  But you can't see it in Explorer to activate the disk.

The answer?  Go to Start, Computer and you will see the floppy drive there proudly labeled as Drive A.  Click on it, and it starts the drive, and NOW it shows up in Windows Explorer!  The only catch is that, when you change disks, it retains the info from the prior disk and adds the new disk data to what you are seeing.

767,5.0,"02 8, 2016",A1HR2ZK9FRJ2AW,B0099QUECK,"Worked as advertised. Plugged into my Win 7 Pro 64-Bit SP1 HP computer. Did not see any driver loading or searching activity. Opened Windows Explorer and Drive A: was listed. Inserted a 720KB (DD) disk and waited for a minute or two.

THIS IS IMPORTANT. Several reviewers mention this: you have to be patient. Apparently, working data through the FDD-USB-MOBO signal interface is not instant like it was when Windows / PCs actually supported floppy disk drives (newer computers don't any more BTW, directly at least).

Anyhow, when the floppy disk drive got quiet and the drive activity light went out, I clicked on View / Refresh and the disk contents appeared, sub-directories and all. I read a few files including opening a 14-year-old TTF font file and it displayed / printed faultlessly.

I then did the same with a 1.44MB (HD) floppy disk without any problems.

The only caveat I ran into was that it does not always know when you change disks. The View / Refresh handles that nicely. I can live with this since it is the ONLY USB FD I found that can actually read _both_ 720KB (DD) and 1.44MB(HD) disks. I have not tried writing yet because I want to archive my 250+ disks before taking any chances with the data (trying to write to a disk). I will provide feedback when writing has been tried.

When disconnecting the USB floppy disk, follow the rules (as you always should). Click on the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" icon and click on ""Eject Floppy Drive"". When the message pops up, you can unplug the cable and put the drive away. I would suggest storing it in the box it came in, in the bag it came in. Dust was always the enemy of floppy drives.

Note: Yes, the box states it includes the drive, a disc and a manual. The disc is ONLY needed for Windows 98 and 98SE systems (because they did not properly support USB). Windows 95 never properly supported USB so it is out. The disc is NOT needed for any later operating system. Now, I've heard that Win8 and WinX have additional problems (because Microsoft has begun leaving out standard system drivers so I am told). That's on Microsoft and I would hammer on their door nice and loudly if you have an issue there. In any event, the DESCRIPTION for this product states that ONLY the drive is included thus it is accurate. Ergo, giving low ratings on this account merely highlights that reviewer's inability to read English. RIF

P.S. My drive did include a manual but it doesn't say much beyond (1) you need a USB port, (2) your OS may assign it any letter (not always A:) , (3) go ahead and plug it in, and (4) you only need a driver for Win98/98Se systems. The supported system list reads, Win 98 / 98SE / 2KPro / ME / XP. But it works fine on my Win 7 Pro system so I suspect it will work on any newer Win OS in the stock configuration (with the caveat already mentioned) So, if your box didn't have one you didn't miss much. ^_^",hde external usb 1.44 mb 3.5&rdquo; floppy disk drive,HDE

Boring details::

- Serious nostalgia trip. It survived my tears of joy as I viewed how well I used to write and comment C code a quarter century ago.
- If you're like me, you were concerned after reading all the reviews for USB floppy drives. After all, who the f still manufactures these things? Yesterday, I bought two from different sources, assuming, at best, that one would work. I started with this one and it worked. Unbelievably, every floppy was readable..
- We are  all reliant upon the statistics of reviews. Before purchasing this, I read 20% negative reviews on many makes of USB floppy drives, some claiming that the manufacturers were just sticking surplus floppy drives from salvaged computers into cases with a USB interface. This may be true. I have no idea. I am not going to break open this product to see if the drive is 20 years old.

The main thing to watch with a drive like this is its reliability over time. Many manufacturers make this same exact drive just with a different label on it.

The only possible caveats to this drive seem to be a short, attached USB cord (you may need an extender cable - the attached cord is perhaps two feet) and there was an odd pause during the middle of the file transfer. No intervention was necessary but the pause was long enough (perhaps 20 seconds) to make me look twice at the drive and consider reconnecting. The transfer succeeded, however, without additional action. All files were intact and opened perfectly.

908,3.0,"05 22, 2012",A3A0J4EBAIMGMD,B00AT491L6,"Well, based on the other reviews that I read about this product, I really was worried that it was going to be the piece of junk that people were making it out to be.  My old machine with Windows XP died on me, so I had a bunch of floppies that I wanted to copy over and turn into archives.  At first, yes, I was having problems with this thing.  But the funny thing is, after some experimentation, it finally started working.

First off, the installation couldn't have been simpler.  Windows 7 (I'm running the 64-bit version) detected it right away, and I didn't have to install a driver, so everything was completely plug and play.  (It shows up as an icon just like any other drive in your system.)  Other plusses include the fact that it doesn't require an extra power connection, and it's also very lightweight.  Unfortunately, when I tried to get it to read my disks, I was getting the same kinds of error messages that other people who reviewed this drive were getting.  Want to know what the fix was?

Sliding each disk's write-protect notch into the other position.

Now, I can't guarantee that will work for you as well, but that's what I did, and then in no time it was reading every disk that I put in it.  Granted, this fix is not necessarily obvious, and it shouldn't be necessary -- based on the product description, the drive should simply do what it's supposed to do and work, and it shouldn't depend on any special actions performed by the user.

So, what it amounts to is that I was able to complete my objective with this device, which was to copy all my old 3.5"" floppy disks over into my current rig.  Granted, it is true that this drive does not recognize low-density floppies.  That definitely is kind of a bummer, since I had to transfer those over to high-density disks first with my ancient laptop before I could bring them into my new machine.  In the end, purchasing this product is a gamble.  It may work for you without any hassle whatsoever, or you may need to do what I did, or -- in a worst-case scenario -- it may not work at all.  All I can do when judging this device is to base it on my own personal experience.  It worked, but it was not 100% straightforward.  At least it wasn't severely expensive.  Best of luck to you if you buy this drive -- you *might* need it.","bytecc bt-144 slim black usb external floppy disk drive, plug &amp; play, usb powered",Bytecc
909,5.0,"02 4, 2012",A3VVOOWJLMQHLW,B00AT491L6,"For years I've been a writer by profession. For a long time I've had a large number of 3.5"" floppy disks taking up shelf space in my home office since for quite a while I haven't had a computer that has a floppy disk drive. The thought of having to ditch all that stuff was unpleasant, to say the least. With this slim external disk drive (and it IS slim -- and light) I solved the problem. And very easily.

It doesn't say on the box that this drive works with Windows 7 (it says it works with Win 98/2000/ME/XP/Vista). But it does. When you plug it into a USB port, Windows 7 automatically and quickly finds the needed driver. And within literally seconds you're ready to move or copy your files to your hard drive, a flash drive or wherever.

As someone else warned, this drive works only with high density (2HD) disks. Just one of my disks wasn't high density, so I didn't lose much.

Now if only my old Iomega ZIP drive would plug in with a VGA-USB cable and work with Windows 7 I'd be able to salvage a lot more old files. Too bad it doesn't. But at least this drive works, and works well.

(One other thing: If you're moving/copying word processing files, as I have been, you may run into a problem with MS Word if you're using Office 2010 and your files use much older versions of Word, as its ""backwards compatible"" in only a limited way. Most of my files were written with WordPerfect, fortunately, which is entirely backwards compatible and which also lets you save files in a very large range of formats.)","bytecc bt-144 slim black usb external floppy disk drive, plug &amp; play, usb powered",Bytecc

The cable is about two feet long and the right length for my set up.

Some of my floppy disks are more than ten years old.  Some were not read by the drive.  That is not the fault of the drive.

After a short time while the computer was discovering new hardware, Windows Explorer added Floppy Drive A:  Removing and changing the diskette does NOT force a new read, which was expected based on some other comments I read here. Unplugging the drive, waiting a few seconds, and plugging it back in, THEN inserting the diskette worked every time I tried it.

About some diskettes not reading -- that shouldn't be too surprising. Floppy diskette construction and design used about the same theory as cassette tapes - synthetic media with metal powder sprayed on it . Like cassettes, floppies start degrading from day one, and the Grim Reaper of disposable consumer media gets closer every time you actually USE the product.  Handling, dust, and incidental magnetism, such as being near a loudspeaker, play their part, too.

I plan to hook it up only when I need it and store it in its box in a cool place when I don't need it. It may not last forever, but what does? For what it costs, it works, and it works OK.","bytecc bt-144 slim black usb external floppy disk drive, plug &amp; play, usb powered",Bytecc

UPDATE 7/25/14:  I rated this a 5 in my first review because it worked fine.  As time has passed it has come to my having to do some manipulating to get the drive to work because I keep getting a disk not formatted/request to format message.

I handle that by unplugging the usb from my computer, plugging it back in and if that doesn't work I then take the disk out and reinsert it in the a drive.  I have to do this a few times until eventually it works.

UPDATE 7/27/14:  Normally this unit sits unplugged on the tower, plugging it in only when I need it, pulling it out of the usb when I'm done.  Tried something different and it made a difference.  After using it yesterday I left it plugged in, even when I logged off.  When I got on the computer later, and today as well and had to transfer files, it worked smoothly.

980,4.0,"09 2, 2013",A20DDH4NT6Q1E8,B00BLTW48U,"Like other reviewers, I purchased this drive to try to nab old stuff from my collection of 3.5"" floppy diskettes.  I am using Windows 7 Pro (64-bit) and the drive works out of the box for me.  The box also included a mini-cd which I did not need to use. I just plugged the drive into a USB slot and Win7 instantly recognized it and found a driver.

However, as my heading says, this drive will only read High Density 1.44mb diskettes (2HD).  I also have some older 2DD diskettes (double sided 720k) which this drive will not read, but rather prompt me to 'format a blank diskette.' (TIP: don't do this! You'll lose your data)  Unsure if this was Windows 7 or the drive itself, I plugged this into an older Windows XP pc (which instantly recognized it too) and it still would not read any of my lower density diskettes (2DD).  It actually says this in the product description, although in a convoluted way for those unaware of the two different types of 3.5"" floppies.  It will ONLY read your 1.44mb (2HD) diskettes.

How do you tell what sort of floppy diskette you have?  If you have name brand floppies, the stamp on the metal slide cover should tell you if your disk is 2HD or 2DD. That said, I have some diskettes that have no branding or marking on them whatsoever, so it's just trial and error.  Some of these work (the 2HD ones) and some don't (which I assume are 2DD).

Bear in mind, this technology was pre ""plug and play"" so even though Windows recognizes the drive and it's ready to use, it won't be active until you pop in a diskette and click the ""3.5 A Drive"" from the drive list in My Computer.  Then you wait and wait and wait for it to access the data (which is so slow compared to today's tech!).  Once you remove that diskette (when the  drive access light is off), you need to refresh the contents of a new diskette by again clicking the ""3.5 A Drive"" from the drive list.  Rinse and repeat.

I purchased this drive from ""FromWarehouse"" vendor.  It was as advertised and works great for me with Windows 7 Pro.

Using WinImage I was able to image aging floppies with ""bad spots"" (and ignore them even if I couldn't find a way to do so automatically) in order to retrieve data I wanted.

1009,4.0,"11 29, 2017",A11GBDVXJSTXSX,B00E9MD700,"I was trying to recover data from floppies to my Windows 10 Home machine. I ended up trying five different devices and am posting my review to let you know my results.
First, all five devices worked PERFECTLY on my Windows 7 Pro laptop. However, when plugging in to my Windows 10 machine, three of them would only sit and spin with the drive light on, even though they were recognized as drives by Win10.

After a little looking, I found that the devices that worked on my Windows 10 machine identified themselves and used the driver for the Y-E Data USB floppy, while the devices that just sat and spun identified themselves and used the driver for a TEAC floppy drive. So there must be a little difference in the internal configuration of the drive that is causing the issue.

I tried 5 devices and found that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tendak-USB-Floppy-Disk-Drive/dp/B01NCV01GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tendak USB Floppy Disk Drive</a>&nbsp;worked perfectly, as did the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Esynic-USB-Floppy-Drive/dp/B01GHF5VS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Esynic USB Floppy Drive </a>. Both identified as Y-E Data USB floppy drives. When they were plugged in, they worked smoothly and quietly. It was a toss-up which one to choose to keep, but I eventually went with the Tendak because it seemed slightly quieter and faster, but that was really subjective. The Tendak also had more information such as a warranty card and information on how to contact support, while the Esynic box was empty. As far as quality of the drive, they seemed identical. If I had needed more than one drive, I would have kept them both.

For me, initially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrent-External-USB-1-44-MB-2x-Floppy-Disk-Drive-FL-UDRV/dp/B00E9MD700/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV)</a>&nbsp;seemed the nicest. The box was glossy with information covering it, you'd expect to see this sitting on a shelf in a big box store. (All other drives came in plain brown boxes). There were touches of quality in how the drive was packed, the box was made to fit it with a area for the cable to fit in and a dust cover over the USB end to keep it clean. It came with a beautiful guide to using the floppy, including information like the write-protect switch and not removing a floppy while the drive light is on, that newer users would not be familiar with. They also had a support phone number, and the person who answered seemed to be an American. Unfortunately, this was one of the devices that would not work on my Windows 10 machine. It identified as a TEAC USB Floppy drive, and when plugged in it simply had the drive light turn on and continuously seek for data. It worked perfectly in my Windows 7 machine, and was very fast and smooth. The support representative was not aware of any issue that would prevent it from working on my machine, and it does work on other people's Windows 10 machines. If I hadn't needed it working on my Windows 10 machine as well, I would have kept this one in a heartbeat. From other reviews, it appears that it works on other people's Windows 10 machines, so I'd recommend you at least try it.

The last two devices were both from Chuanganzhuo.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-5-34-USB-External-Floppy-Disk-Drive-Portable-1-44-MB-FDD-for-PC-Windows-2000-XP-Vista-7-8-10-for-Mac-No-Extra-Driver-Required-Plug-and-Play-Black/dp/B00RXEWOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3.5"" USB External Floppy Disk Drive Portable 1.44 MB FDD for PC Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10,for Mac,No Extra Driver Required,Plug and Play,Black</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-5-34-USB-External-Floppy-Disk-Drive-Portable-1-44-MB-FDD-for-PC-Windows-2000-XP-Vista-Windows-7-8-10-Dustproof-Scratch-Resistant-External-Bag-Case-No-External-Driver-Plug-and-Play/dp/B00WSW1YXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3.5"" USB External Floppy Disk Drive Portable 1.44 MB FDD for PC Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7/8/10 +Dustproof Scratch-Resistant External Bag Case,No External Driver,Plug and Play</a>. Both devices worked fine on Windows 7 Pro, but on Windows 10 Home they immediately had the drive light up and started a very loud seek process that never finished. These devices were louder than any other drive I tested, but did work just fine under Windows 7. Both used the TEAC USB Floppy driver as well.

My conclusion: If you are lucky enough to be one of those whose computers will use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrent-External-USB-1-44-MB-2x-Floppy-Disk-Drive-FL-UDRV/dp/B00E9MD700/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV)</a>, get that drive.

I was curious what was on these drives, but since it's the 2010s now, I didn't own any computers capable of reading a floppy. I bought this and it did the job. The ""2x"" was pretty useful. Technically, I'm not sure how it works, but it reads data off the disks at double the speed. Granted, in today's world, 2x feels like an eternity, it's better than reading them at 1x speed.

A few of them were bad, but this drive helped up transfer the data from the working disks to our network drive.

I'm using Windows 10, and I had some issues with changing disks; It didn't want to refresh the list of files, like it would only read the FAT once and then cache it. I found that the best way to change the disks was to remove the USB device, eject the current disk, plug in the USB device, then insert the new disk.

To improve the speed of this, I copied all the files over using the command prompt. I found opening the disk using Windows Explorer to be very slow. I think it was trying to preview each file or something.",sabrent external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive (fl-udrv),Sabrent

I have a ton of old 3.5"" floppies with important files on them.  Don't judge - I just hadn't gotten around to getting everything off them. Stuff going back into the early 1990's that I would hate to lose. So what do you do? You keep stacks of those things and say ""one day I'll get around to moving those all to a hard drive"". Well, that day is today.

There are a bunch of negative reviews here about it not quite working without the secret squirrel hand-shake, or a Ouija board, or not at all, but I plugged this into an open USB port on my 2 year old Dell laptop running Windows 10 (Version 10.0.10586) and it was instantly recognized. A moment later I was opening little tiny 1.44MB time capsules of 25 year old floppy disc data.

A word of caution to those readers also doing a digital Indiana Jones routine: storage media can and will fail over time. I have three stacks of discs on my desk right now - Discs I haven't read yet, discs I have read, copied and wiped clean, and discs that should have had data on them and did not. Thankfully, that last stack is a very small fraction of the total.

This drive is an excellent way to get my files into the 21st century. Don't wait until technology leaves your backup media in the dark ages.",sabrent external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive (fl-udrv),Sabrent
1178,3.0,"08 5, 2016",A2RL63K0D6FF1Z,B00E9MD700,"Sorry, won't work on either Win 8.1 or Win XP machines, not on mine, anyway. Guess I received a defective item, but I'm not taking any chances with replacements. Messed up the settings on my XP machine. Returned 59 Event ID 7 disk errors on my Win 8.1 machine. Said discs were not formatted. On XP machine, system nearly froze. Piece of junk. I followed all instructions carefully. In the end, it reported that discs were unformatted (but they were, and had files on them), or had bad blocks (which they don't, because they work in my old floppy drives that came with the XP machine), and on and on. Wasted an afternoon on this. Back it goes. I'll go back to my old system. Use the legacy FDDs on my XP machines, transfer files via USB stick to 8.1 machine. A pain I was hoping to avoid, but not as bad as this.

Edit and update: Manny from Sabrent was kind enough to get in touch with me and send me a new unit. It does work on my XP machines, but I am sorry to report that it still won't work on my Win 8.1 machines. Following is my report to Manny:
........
The news on the unit is mixed. It worked fine on my XP machine. Even reads and writes to 720kB discs, despite what the box says.

However, the bad news is that it won't work on any of my Windows 8.1 machines. One is a custom-built gaming PC; one is a Lenovo laptop; and one is a Microsoft Surface 3. It won't work on any of them. I ran the troubleshooter on the PC and it said that it won't work with USB 3.0 -- but that computer has USB 2.0 ports as well as 3.0, and the drive was plugged into the USB 2.0 input. And I had tweaked the BIOS to force floppy on that input. The laptop also had a USB 2.0 input, but there was no setting in the BIOS I could change. The Surface tablet only has one USB port, and that is USB 3.0.

The behavior was the same with all three computers. Insert the drive connector into the port, wait for the port to register. The green line is drawn across the top of the frame. It never completes, the process freezes, and the user is unable to remove or eject the unit. The only recourse is to yank the connector out of the port. In the Event Viewer there is no error listed, but there is a warning:

The fault must be with the Mitsumi drive. The box only lists Windows compatibility up through Windows 7. It must not work with 8 or higher.

I bought this on Amazon, plugged it into the USB slot on my (Windows 10) desktop and it whirred to life.

BUT the A: drive did not show up on my computer.

Simple solution (thanks to a previous commenter): I put a floppy disk in (more whirring) and opened windows explorer and typed A: in the address bar.  Viola.  I could see all the (quite ancient) files on my floppy disk.

I could open them directly from the disk (at least, the files which are still readable -- for example Word 2016 seems able to open any old word processing files at all but Photoshop couldn't open ancient .pic photo files).

However, it's better to copy all your files to you hard disk and open them from there -- less whirring and more speed.

When I finished copying the files I just pushed the button to eject the disk, then inserted a new disk and clicked on the refresh (circular arrow) icon at the right of the address bar and the files on the new disk were displayed.

I found some great old photos from a trip I took in 1999 and some old documents from 1993 that I wrote in Word Perfect on a DOS computer but they displayed fine in Word 2016.

'Tricks' to get the drive to work?  I did have to swap USB ports to get the drive to recognize.  It does seem to work better if you type the drive letter into the address bar.  A: anyone?  (thanks for those tips folks!)  Pop the diskette out, shake it, flip the shutter door, put it back in, say a prayer, cross whatever you've got handy.  Just like in the old days.

I had read the other reviews, and I will say, I got the item that was advertised.  It did not work ""Plug-N-Play"" as advertised though as I had to plug it in, remove it and plug it in again several times before my HP 6300 Small Form Factor computer running 64 bit Windows 7 Professional would recognize it.  Took about 3/4 hour to get it up and running so at least this one was NOT plug and play.  The main reason I bought it was the fact I had come across a whole bunch of old floppies that came from a Sony Mavica digital camera I once owned.  Some of the pictures I had taken were lost through several hard drive/computer crashes since I had quit using that camera and I wanted to try and recover the pictures.

It DID do that but I wound up having to use the C:\ command line processor to copy the files into a directory on the hard drive.  Windows Explorer would NOT read the directories on the disks, it kept giving me an I/O error..  At first I attributed this to the age of the floppies, but I had a couple of brand new ones that I formatted and wrote some files on.  Win 7 Pro would NOT read the directories on either of these disks either, but using the command line processor, I had absolutely no problem reading any of the disks including the very old ones.  I think Sabrent needs to re-think their system for these things, no matter how cheap they market them.  At first I really was about ready to call Amazon customer service and arrange to send this back, but that would almost be more trouble than it's worth so I'll just remember to use the command prompt to copy any files written to floppy disk using this drive -- By the way, Windows seems to write the files okay to the A: drive, just won't read them through the Windows Explorer interface.

I DO NOT recommend this product for purchase by anyone, I'm sorry to say.  It's not worth the hassle.",sabrent external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive (fl-udrv),Sabrent

Being the nostalgic type, I though ""Man, I sure would like to get some use out of these old things"". So I checked here on Amazon, and found some external floppy disk drives at really great prices. I chose to purchase this one that was described as being a Sabrent branded product. Having had good and bad results with Sabrent, I said what the heck, and bought it. Surprisingly, when I connected the drive to my computer, and opened File Explorer to see if the drive had been detected, it was listed there, not as a Sabrent drive, but as a TEAC brand drive, which in my book is a much better brand. I am not sure which is the correct brand for the product, but it is working well, and I have stored many of my documents on some of the floppy disks that I found.",sabrent external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive (fl-udrv),Sabrent

Recent Linux distros should be able to recognize and mount this device with just a couple of mouse clicks. I tested it on a couple of currently supported Mageia distros and had no problems with it being found and was able to read several floppy formats without a glitch.

Older Linux distros may take a bit more prodding to find the device, but usually just a reboot with the device connected or a scan via the distro's administrative tools will find it and mount it. I tested it with an older Mandriva distro and was able to mount it manually via a command line as root within a terminal session.

For Windows users, I also tested this floppy on Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8.1. All recognized the drive and mounted it for use without any additional user interaction necessary. I will caution users planning on upgrading to Windows 10, that it will not include drivers for USB floppy drives by default in its main package. You will need to download a driver for the floppy drive for Windows 10 from the manufacturer of the device (Sabrent) or from Microsoft after your installation or upgrade of the operating system.

Floppy drives all read DD and HD floppies equally well and so does the Sabrent, but the Mac would not recognize the DD disk's files, even though it did recognize the Sabrent unit.
This is not the fault of the Sabrent unit, just of its description not having enough information for me to make my decision. I had emailed one of these USB floppy drive manufacturers to ask specifically if it would work with an Amiga DD disk connected to a Mac USB and they replied that it definitely would. I thought I had a defective unit until I searched some Mac forums and found the fact that a Mac will NEVER read a DD disk in a USB drive no matter what.

1438,1.0,"06 15, 2015",AWTTI4OF509J6,B00E9MD700,"I am very disappointed in this device.

I have multiple computers, from old legacy computers running Windows 3.11 to modern computers running Windows 8.1, Windows 8.1 Pro, and even one with the Windows 10 Pro Preview Release (now called the Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview).

All of my older computers have internal floppy drives, while few of my newer computers do. There are times when a USEFUL external drive would be handy to have, to transport a file or two from one machine to another, without having to use an intermediate computer that has both USB ports, and floppy drives.

I first tried this Sabrent USB floppy drive unit on my main Windows 8.1 Pro computer. Out of a stack of four or five floppy disks, it was only able to read one of them (and that seems to have been a fluke). I was able to copy two files I needed onto that one floppy disk that this Sabrent USB Floppy device would read, and then used that disk on an internal floppy drive on an older computer to transfer the files. While I had that disk in that older computer, running it in Windows 95 DOS mode, I moved a few files about (while being amazed that I still remembered how to write those old DOS commands), and now the Sabrent USB Floppy device can no longer read that floppy... without doing a reformat first.

I wonder how many people take that option to reformat the disk, either thinking it went bad, or there is nothing on that disk, only to lose what was on that floppy disk? By the way, the data, if there was data on that disk, is still on that disk, it is just that the Sabrent USB floppy drive cannot read it.

Using a Windows XP Home computer, I found that the Sabrent USB Floppy drive could not read any disks, none at all. So I stuck in a disk that I believe was blank, and used the Sabrent USB Floppy drive to format it. That did work, and I was then able to copy a file over to the floppy disk.

Okay, that is a start. At least the device is not a complete waste of money... although I really needed a device to READ EXISTING data on floppies, not just from disks that were formatted by the Sabrent device!

Then, I tried that floppy disk on my Windows 8.1 Pro computer, using the Sabrent device, that had just formatted that disk, and was used to write that data to that disk, and the blasted drive could not read that disk while using a different computer. What the heck???

Further testing shows that I can ONLY read that floppy disk, with the Sabrent USB Floppy drive, in the computer where the disk was formatted and the file was created. Now that is just plain LAME!

The TEAC read all but two of them. Most of these floppies were from 1997-1999, so don't tell me floppies don't last :)
As a test, I checked some of these same disks using the Sabrent plugged into my PC and it was not able to read it from there either
I would say this is not a great ratio.  It works, but if you get a disk error, and the disk is important, I would suggest trying it on a different FDD unit.
I would return it, but the shipping is as much as the unit itself.
I gave it three stars on the original review above

06/09/2015: Update:  After posting this review Sabrent contacted me directly and offered to send a replacement drive free of charge.

Upon plugging in, the drive made a constant clicking noise as if it was reading a disk, even though there was no disk inserted in the drive. It would only stop clicking after a disk was inserted and it was done reading it. After that it sat idle and quiet.

Other than that, the read speed seemed slow. This is attributed to the disk itself im guessing?? I did have one issue of the drive becoming disconnected. Thankfully it did not ruin the disk itself.

It read about 95% of my disks fine. Only had about 2-3 that didn't work. Again, not sure if this was an issue with the disk itself. I don't have access to any other 3.5 floppy drives to test it on, but I figured I would mention it.

I was using it under MAC OSX.

In the end I winded up returning it. I simply could not deal with the clicking noise when it was plugged in. Maybe mine was defective, but I think I may try another brand before trying another one of these.

Using this device on a Windows 7 PC. No installation required. About 2 seconds of auto-install; it's plug-and-play.

However, the product is far from perfect. There's an issue with the device where it will stop reading discs after a couple tries, and will just give an error message saying it can't read the disc and it probably needs to be formatted. Don't format the disc. In the lower-right corner of your screen, click the plug icon and safely remove the device. Once it says it can be removed, physically unplug the external device, wait a few seconds, and plug it back in. It will now read the disc like it's supposed to. Not sure why it craps out after a few disc reads, but at least it can be remedied by unplug/replug. Also, I would occasionally be in the middle of a file transfer/copy and would suddenly get an error stating that it was unable to copy due to an I/O error. This also means that the device needs to be unplugged and plugged back in.

I hope these troubleshooting tips come in handy for those who experience issues! The product does work! If you continue to experience read errors with a specific disc even after unplug/plug, then it's probably the disc.",sabrent external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive (fl-udrv),Sabrent

However, based on other people's reviews, there is really no mechanical problem here, but a software one.

The driver software loads up, plug-and-play fine - ""Ready to use.""  The LED works fine and the motor sounds fine.  However, for any of about 6 Vista formatted floppy disks that work fine in my HP external, the error message keeps saying that I need to format the disk.  When I try to format the disk it says that it can't do it.

I'll bet there is a simple trick to getting this thing to work.  But to any manufacturer who wants to play tricks, I say - mangia !  Back it goes!

If you try the latter, I suggest using Oracle's free Virtual Box software.  Its free and makes mounting drives inside of the enviornment hassle free.

Although this is plug-and-play, a few tips from the manual (found online at the URL mentioned in the slip of paper included in the package) may prevent frustration.

1.  Make sure that the floppy disk you are using is 1.44 MB density. Any other density will not work with this drive.

2.  After plugging the drive into your computer, make sure you allow a full minute or so for the disk to mount before inserting a floppy disk into the drive. Even if the drive shows up as Floppy Disk Drive (A:) right away, it might not read the disk if you don't wait the full minute.

3.  Connect the drive directly into a USB port, and NOT through a USB hub or extension. On some computers, the USB port may not be providing enough power to daisy chain through a 2nd device.

4.  On some computers, the USB ports on the back have more power than the ones in front. So if it's not working when connected to the USB port in front, try one in back.

5.  If the write-protect tab on the disk is closed, the drive might not work with the disk. The tab slides up and down to cover or uncover a square in the upper right-hand corner of the disk (when viewed from the label side). If the square is uncovered, then the disk is write-protected. FWIW, I had no trouble reading write-protected disks.

6.  Before accessing any of the files, highlight (select) all of the files listed (you can use CTRL-A as a shortcut). This will cache the files and make transferring and opening the files much faster. A green progress bar should fill up in the explorer bar. Allow the bar to fill completely before trying to access the files.",sabrent external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive (fl-udrv),Sabrent

1654,1.0,"10 3, 2014",AUE1594CFFB9B,B00E9MD700,"The one I received was junk, and Sabrent's tech support is absolutely clueless. In fact they should be supporting deodorants because it stinks that bad.  Although Sabrent said this was a good way to recover your files from legacy equipment, the tech told me that you should expect to have to reformat all the disk you use with this drive because you can never read a disk created on one computer on another one.  He said that was also true of Hard Drives. Well, then how are we suppose to recovery our old files on legacy disks?
He told me as long as the drive was recognized in a computer it was OK and couldn't be expected to read old disks.  By the way these are commercially created disks (Church Art on a Disk) and I have used them in over 5 other computers.  Anyway I then went from my Windows 7 computer to an old XP computer and again plugged this piece of junk in and it was immediately recognized.  However, once again it wouldn't read the disk.  After about 3 minutes it told me I needed to format the disk if I wanted to use it.  I took the disk out and put it into the floppy reader in my computer and it read the disk fine!  My guess is that the heads are misaligned in this drive.  I have had drives go bad before and then couldn't read what I had saved.  The problem, with age the heads had misaligned and were writing in the wrong place on the disk. I would guess that's what happened in this case.
Apparently, they don't appreciate call backs.  I tried to call tech support a second time and after 45 minutes gave up.  The first time it took me less than 3 minutes!
So my conclusion is this:
1) Their quality control in the factory are very poor at the best.
2) Their customer service is worse yet.
3) Thus, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never again order anything with the name Sabrent (but what can I expect from China) on it.  I saw in another review that this was called a Teac, and if that true their quality is slipped.

What I had to do was ""exercise"" the drive somewhat. With each attempt to read from an old floppy, I got more and more data back, until eventually I got all 1474560 bytes. I ran four of these ""full copies"" from the drive (using the Linux 'dd' command), and then compared them all using the 'md5sum' command. All of them came out the same, which I take to be a good sign. Also of minor interest, the transfer rate increased slightly from the first full correct copy to the fourth.

Now I can access Word docs I wrote while in my first college (never thought I'd be wanting to read those essays again, but I've been feeling a bit nostalgic lately).

Anyway, if it *doesn't work* for you, it could be due to a few things other than receiving a faulty unit:
- floppy discs do have a lifespan... as little as a few years (depends in part on how they were stored)
- are you sure there is data on the disc you inserted? nothing will show up if nothing is there
- sometimes the USB ports on the front of rigs get worn out and the connection isn't so great for certain USB devices. Try plugging this A drive into the back of your rig.

1741,2.0,"10 11, 2014",A26Z25VUQ9PMO1,B00GGFWJWU,"Not very well made.  I tried not to expect too much from this inexpensive part, but -
- 1 of the two USB 3.0 slots does not work at the same higher speed as the other, not sure why, probably the cable though.  I've tried attaching another adapter to the same header pins on the motherboard and they work fine.
-  the ports themselves are not very strong. The metal that surrounds them is split underneath by design and it came apart when I plugged a cable into the ports.  Happened on both sides, though I was very careful second time I plugged a cable into a port.  The frame of the adapter is not very rigid either, so you can expect to use this in a bay that uses pressure to hold it in - it will just buckle.

So, this may be worth the price, but I'd look for more value.  I'm going to try a 3.5"" bay adapter that has two USB3.0 ports, a 24"" cord, AND it holds 2 x SSD drives (or other 2.5"" devices) I'd never heard of such, but I'd like to replace this mutt, and now that I've found the other, I'll bet the quality is at least comparable, and it offers more options so it will save space by using the same 3.5 inch bay for the SSD drives and the USB3.0 front ports.

On the 11th, upon inserting a disk (as I had done previously), the lower read head broke off, making the entire drive useless. I could hear parts rattling around inside, so I knew something wasn't right. I opened the drive up to see what the issue was, and that's when the head fell out in two pieces. Upon inspection, it had been popped off by the motion of the inserting disk. The heads are supposed to retract (upward and downward respectively) when the disk isn't in the drive, and then, only at the last second, pop onto the disk surface. Instead, this lower read head remained up, at least partially, and when the disk was inserted, it popped the head off.

I won't bother sending it in for replacement because I opened it up.

On the plus side, I liked the packaging (box that would be good to store it in without wasting space), and it did pop right up when I plugged it in (Win 8.1 Pro on 6-year-old motherboard/USB controller). On the disks I did manage to copy, it took about 90 seconds from the moment I hit Ctrl+V until the pasting was done.

It cannot read a floppy disk in Windows 7 64bit, It cannot read a floppy in Linux Ubuntu 14.04 64bit, It cannot read a floppy in Windows XP 32 bit. This USB Floppy Disk Drive .. (NRG Tech External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive) will not read a floppy disk at all. When a disk is inserted and the drive is accessed, Windows (all) reports the floppy is not formatted .. Would you like to format it now? You can say yes and the little format window will come up and then you get a message - ""Windows was unable to complete the format."" Linux cannot access anything on the floppy. It keeps on trying, but never succeeds. The drive shows up in Windows and Linux, the light comes on when the drive is accessed. I also tried this drive on another laptop with windows 7 32 bit and it failed again to read a floppy. I tested all the floppy disk in 2 different internal floppy drives. The floppy disk do contain data and they all read fine in the internal drives. I guess I jumped to quick and purchased the wrong brand  / wrong usb external floppy drive. I thought the 5 star reviews, would mean it would work fine out of the box. Sadly that isn't the case. I had a bunch of things I wanted to do this weekend with the new drive and the laptop, but now I have to try and find a decent drive that actually works! Keep in mind when you are looking for an external floppy drive: What will it read? I have a mix of floppy disk. Both: 3.5 - 720kbs & 3.5 - 1.44 kbs. Some USB external floppy drives will read 720 ds/dd disk and some will Not! You should try and find out if the drive you are looking at - reads both. (720KB - 3.5"" = DS/DD & 1.44MB - 3.5"" = DS/HD). I have lots of both, So I'm going to get one ""eventually"" that works and reads both. Update: I received a email reply from from NRGTech. (After emailing them as they requested.) They were very concerned about the negative feedback and informed me that I received a ""free"" 2 year warranty with the drive. They pretty much said to give them time to deal with the problem before leaving negative feed back. I've decided to return the drive for a refund. I will update this review when I get (buy) a new drive. I will provide information on what I get, what it reads, writes and formats, so Stay Tuned!

Note to reviewers: Saying it works doesn't tell anyone much. The reviews of this USB floppy drive is a good example. Look at the reviews. What floppy disk can the drive read? Can it read a 720 kbs ds/dd? or just 1.44 kbs ds/hd? Can it format a disk? On what type of machine are you using it? On a Mac? On a PC? On a Linux machine? What Operating System is the computer using? Is it XP, ME, Vista, 7 or 8.1? Mac OS 9.2.2, Mac OS X v10.0, Mac OS X v10.5? Linux Ubuntu? Fedora Linux? PC Linux? Linux Mint? System details are very important .. Just saying!",nrg tech external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive,NRG Tech

1770,4.0,"12 1, 2014",A9VIDJISJ134B,B00K2JMB56,"I bought this in preparation for an upcoming project for a client who still runs some DOS applications. The day will come when the computer this is running on will die, and I'll end up having to load up a VM on a new system off of floppies. As such I've done some testing, but not yet used in a live fire event.

Pros:
1.) I have tested this device plugged into 2 different Windows PC's and a Mac. Each recognized it as a floppy drive and would read and write to a disk.
2.) OS's tested were Win7, Win8.1, Linux Mint 17, OSX 10.6.8. Each operated as expected.
3.) Self contained unit, powered from USB connection.
4.) Cable length of 22"" from the connector to the drive is long enough for situations where the USB has to plug into the back of the case and the drive pulled around to the front.

Cons:
None yet

My only other observation is that the first floppy I stuck in the drive could not be read. I'll cut the device some slack because it was a Windows 3.0 floppy from 1990, so 24 years in a box have taken their toll. Heck even when 3.5"" floppies were cutting edge they were not the most reliable things to deal with. The other disks I tried worked without a problem.",nrg tech external usb 1.44 mb 2x floppy disk drive,NRG Tech

Typical error that the diskettes need to be reformatted, but then when you try on the new ones, it won't even format.  It is supposed to work on Windows 7 64-bit, which is what I have, but useless.

1809,2.0,"11 15, 2016",AVJ6URCLNJQD2,B00KX8EMOO,"I gave this 2 stars instead of only 1 because it does function, but only if you're willing to plug and unplug its USB cable for each diskette you want to access. And because that's the only way I could get it to work, I don't think it deserves a higher score, especially when there are others available that function properly and cost only a few dollars more.

I bought this drive because my daughter needed to access some papers she wrote in college a number of years ago. The drive is plug and play -- no drivers need to be loaded manually -- but it does not recognize when a diskette has been ejected. Instead, it continues to display the diskette contents as if the diskette is still in the drive. And when a different diskette is inserted, the drive does not make any attempt to read the 2nd diskette. Instead, it continues to display info from the 1st diskette, the one that was ejected. As mentioned by other reviewers, the only way to get the drive to recognize the 2nd diskette is to unplug the drive's USB cable, then plug it back in. I had this drive plugged into the back of my desktop PC, so you can imagine how much I wanted to do that on a regular basis. I returned the drive as soon as I discovered its shortcoming.

The moment my drive arrived I could tell that the plastic in the front of the drive was warped, and the door was being blocked off from opening as a result. I was able to push it open but it kept opening weirdly.

I plugged in the drive to my windows 10 laptop and it was detected just fine. However I inserted a disk and I continuously started getting read errors and write errors. Most of the time they were ""Disk not formatted"" errors even though I knew they worked just fine in my dos machine and an older USB floppy drive I have. I tried everything to get this drive to work, messed with window settings, tried 3 different computers and tried tons more diskettes. I kept getting the same results, errors after errors. I even blew into the drive and a dust cloud shot out of it! I was pretty upset about it so I got an exchange from Amazon (Thank you for the excellent customer support!), in hopes it was just a lemon.

Nope, I plugged it in, got it to work for about 30 seconds (Though the drive was a little quieter than the first one), and it started throwing the same errors as before, mainly on writing. I even plugged in some old elder scrolls diskettes and ran Dosbox, but it would not read those either. Again tried different computers and settings, but nothing worked. I returned it and got a refund, again thanks to Amazon's amazing support.

1868,3.0,"10 26, 2015",A1R7J7JBIZ8OKU,B00KX8EMOO,"This drive is quick, and works great for accessing old 3.5 floppy disks.
The installation is easy; it has a plug-and-play interface so it should work as soon the cable is connected, but if that doesn't work it comes with a small disk with the drivers for manual installation.
It doesn't have a problem with reading the disks, but one quirk of the drive is that occasionally the device driver fails and causes it to misread a disk as either corrupted or non-formatted. If this happens, you do not want to format your disk (unless you're absolutely sure it is a disk failure) because your data is fine.
To fix the driver (on a windows machine at least):
-You need to go into the device manager (located under Computer > Properties)
-Uninstall the driver under ""floppy disk drives"" (it will say something like ""Y-E DATA USB-FDU"").
-Then unplug the floppy drive and plug it back in.
This will reinstall the device driver for the floppy drive, and the disk should be able to be read like normal.
Quirks aside, I've had the drive for close to a year now and it still works well.",newstyle usb -3.5 external floppy disk drive,NEWSTYLE

Edit: I opened the thing up to hopefully salvage the drive. The eject mechanism is flawed in a manner I can't believe is present in a production device. IF THE EJECT MECHANISM STICKS (and it will) DO NOT FORCE THE FLOPPY OUT LIKE I DID. This destroyed the floppy disk and the drive head. Open the drive as follows:

1. UNPLUG the drive.
2. Remove the single screw on the bottom side and use a flathead screwdrive to pop open the case.
3. Remove the metal chassis. Unscrew the single screw on the top, rear side that is in a bit of an indentation in the jacket. Slide the jacket backwards and remove.
4. There is a white plastic arm. Push it forward and the disk should fly out the front. If not, push the disk back into the drive and then push the white plastic arm forward. Repeat a few times until it works. Wiggle the eject button, too.
5. Replace the metal jacket, and I would say don't replace the plastic case at this point since you'll need to unstick many disks, but it might be a shock hazard to touch the metal, I don't know. So I'm not going to say that. Replace the plastic case but don't screw it back.
6. Go back in time and don't buy this drive in the first place.

What a shoddy, shoddy piece of craftsmanship. As far as I can tell, every USB floppy drive sold on Amazon is suspect.

Unlike other users who said they had Windows 7 issues, I had absolutely no problem using this with Windows 7 Home Premium.  As soon as I plugged it in, the device was picked up and mapped to my A: drive without needing any additional drivers.

I also didn't need to unplug and plug back in between disks like some other reviewers mentioned.  I just put in a new disk and refreshed the driver folder.

Out of the 20 or so floppies I wanted to read, it did manage to read about 95% of the data.  Though that rate is likely based on the fact that the floppies are old as dirt.

The device itself was noisy, but you have to keep in mind this is an external drive. I don't remember the internal floppy drives ever being all that quiet either.

He reports that there are some discs that the drive can't read, but since it does so well on some of them, I'm assuming that the problem is with the individual discs that have been around for 10 or 15 years, stored in places that were probably bad for them, and otherwise abused.

Comments:

1. Surprisingly nice quality of construction
2. Installed itself under Win 7 in a few seconds
3. Recognized the first disk I inserted and read it perfectly, and every disk thereafter
4. Brought back memories of how slow 3.5"" floppies really were (not the fault of the drive)
5. The actual manufacturer of the drive is NEC

NOTE:  If you plug the drive in and no motor starts whirring or lights come on, don't assume it's defective.  The drive will ONLY spin up after you insert a disk AND manually select Drive A on your list of drives, then it goes dormant again until you mouse click on a file you want to open.  I think that's why some people thought they received a defective drive.

[UPDATE] - I hadn't finished the task of copying the old floppies yet and recently bought a new high-end computer with Win 7 - 64 bit (by choice). Same as before, the drive was recognized instantly and had no problem reading the disks. I offer this to others who are trying to work with old floppies that may be 30 years old ... it may not be this drive but simply that with time those old disks have aged to the point they are just not usable. 95% of mine read fine but a few were simply too old and dried out to spin properly.",newstyle usb -3.5 external floppy disk drive,NEWSTYLE

Then I got out a cleaning disk and put that in the drive with some cleaning solution on it, but that did not help it to read the floppies.  I have a really old 386 computer with a floppy drive and IT was able to read these disks that could not be read by the Pwow.  Strangely, a week later when I tried some of these questionable disks again, it COULD read them!  So I am not sure what to make of this drive, but it is the best that's available at the moment.

I encountered a point where the drive was acting strangely and was almost ready to throw it away!  There were all sorts of disk read errors and other problems that didn't make much sense.  The USB port I was using then was working well for other devices, but I decided to check the internal connection to my motherboard anyway and it appeared SLIGHTY ajar. Making it super tight solved the problem with the Pwow!  So it does seem to be much more sensitive to connection problems than other USB devices. Keep that in mind.

The on line description on Amazon shows this to be compatible from Windows 98 all the way through Windows 8.  It says nothing about a Mac.

The box says Windows 98 through Windows XP AND Mac.  Nothing about Windows 7 or 8.

The printed instructions only say that Windows 98/98SE, 2000 Professional, ME, and XP are supported.  Nothing about Macs.

The box also says it contains a ""CD-ROM for Driver.  It does not.  The printed instructions also say there is a CD with drivers on it.  Not so. Therefore, I have no way of knowing if this would even work with older editions of Windows before Windows 7, let alone a Mac (Windows 7 installed the proper driver automatically for me).  The instructions only have information about driver installation for those old operating systems, with tiny screen shots too small to read even if you needed them.

The Amazon description says this is a ""USB 2.0"" device, yet nothing in the printed instructions or on the box says this is anything beyond USB 1.0.  I don't have a way of easily determining transfer speeds, so I have no idea whether the USB 2.0 claim is true or not.

For all I know, I've got a 14 year old floppy drive that's been sitting in a warehouse since 2001 when Windows XP first came out.  This has every appearance of being very old technology from a different era, NOT what's advertised on Amazon.  I'm keeping it solely because I need a floppy drive, and this at least reads/writes.

Also, if you need to locate the device at any reasonable distance away from your computer, forget about it.  The USB cable is only 23 inches long - barely enough to plug into a USB port toward the upper back side of a desktop computer, come around to the front of the computer, and lay right next to the computer on the desk.  Very UN-generous cable connection.

Bottom line: it works at some unknown transfer speed, it reads accurately, and it writes accurately.  You get what you pay for in this case.","3.5&quot; usb external floppy disk drive portable 1.44 mb fdd pc windows 2000/xp/vista/7/8/10 mac,no extra driver required,plug play,black",Chuanganzhuo

The bad: put in my first floppy, and spun for a VERY long time, and then told me I needed to format the disk. Maybe a bad floppy?
Tried two and then three with the same results. Then I discovered the big BUG in this product. Once you insert a disk, that disk remains ""cached"" in memory of this driver. Changing disks results in the previous disk just showing up again. So when I inserted a bad disk, every disk after that registered as bad. Same is true if you inserted a good disk. Eject it and insert a new disk, and what you get in explorer is the same disk as the first. But of course, when you try and look at a file, it fails.  The only solution to this problem is to disconnect the drive after ejecting a floppy, and then reconnect it before inserting the next. I tried this on two Windows 7 machines and one XP machine with the same results.
The good again: When it actually reads a floppy correctly, it is great to gain access to my old floppies with old files I can now access and copy. I will be using this to throw away boxes of floppies.

If you use one disk, then eject it and insert another, the device doesn't inform the software that this happened, so the software still sees the content of the original disk. Even doing a ""refresh"", or closing and re-opening explorer doesn't make a difference. As far as I can see, the only way to switch between disks is to physically unplug the drive between each disk!

Also, if you use virtual machines then you should be aware that this device is NOT seen as a real floppy disk drive by Windows (it's emulated in software). This means that it isn't visible to software like VMware Workstation, and so can't be connected to client VM's. As this was my primary requirement, I'll be returning it.

It installed itself on my Windows 10 x64 computer, the a drive showed up on windows explorer and was able to read the old disks flawlessly. I have used computers from the beginning (pre IBM PC) and have a large amount of MS-DOS and early Windows disks. The only downside is that many of the programs of that era used proprietary formats to save the files and today it is hard to fined a program to open and read them but I knew this when I ordered the drive. If you have like I do a large amount of old disks you need to see what is on them and possibly retrieve files, this drive will do the job. It appears to be well constructed and looks like it should hold up well (only time will tell).","3.5&quot; usb external floppy disk drive portable 1.44 mb fdd pc windows 2000/xp/vista/7/8/10 mac,no extra driver required,plug play,black",Chuanganzhuo
2242,3.0,"11 22, 2017",A11GBDVXJSTXSX,B00RXEWOAA,"I bought this floppy drive to use to recover old games and data. I have multiple computers, and was able to get this to work just fine on a Windows 7 Pro laptop, but on my Windows 10 Home desktop the drive just sat and spun. I plugged it in and the light came on and the drive turned... and turned... and turned... in addition, it was very noisy. I tried both front and back USB ports, nothing made a difference. I see other people have been able to get it to work on Windows 10, but I did not have another Windows 10 machine to try to see if it was an issue with my computer or with the drive. Since it would not work on the newer machine, I am returning it to get a different drive that will work. Again, it did work fine on my Windows 7 machine, so it appears to be a problem with 10  (or my machine) only.

Update: I was trying to recover data from floppies to my Windows 10 Home machine. I ended up trying five different devices and am posting my review to let you know my results.
First, all five devices worked PERFECTLY on my Windows 7 Pro laptop. However, when plugging in to my Windows 10 machine, three of them would only sit and spin with the drive light on, even though they were recognized as drives by Win10.

After a little looking, I found that the devices that worked on my Windows 10 machine identified themselves and used the driver for the Y-E Data USB floppy, while the devices that just sat and spun identified themselves and used the driver for a TEAC floppy drive. So there must be a little difference in the internal configuration of the drive that is causing the issue.

I tried 5 devices and found that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tendak-USB-Floppy-Disk-Drive/dp/B01NCV01GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tendak USB Floppy Disk Drive</a>&nbsp;worked perfectly, as did the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Esynic-USB-Floppy-Drive/dp/B01GHF5VS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Esynic USB Floppy Drive </a>. Both identified as Y-E Data USB floppy drives. When they were plugged in, they worked smoothly and quietly. It was a toss-up which one to choose to keep, but I eventually went with the Tendak because it seemed slightly quieter and faster, but that was really subjective. The Tendak also had more information such as a warranty card and information on how to contact support, while the Esynic box was empty. As far as quality of the drive, they seemed identical. If I had needed more than one drive, I would have kept them both.

For me, initially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrent-External-USB-1-44-MB-2x-Floppy-Disk-Drive-FL-UDRV/dp/B00E9MD700/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV)</a>&nbsp;seemed the nicest. The box was glossy with information covering it, you'd expect to see this sitting on a shelf in a big box store. (All other drives came in plain brown boxes). There were touches of quality in how the drive was packed, the box was made to fit it with a area for the cable to fit in and a dust cover over the USB end to keep it clean. It came with a beautiful guide to using the floppy, including information like the write-protect switch and not removing a floppy while the drive light is on, that newer users would not be familiar with. They also had a support phone number, and the person who answered seemed to be an American. Unfortunately, this was one of the devices that would not work on my Windows 10 machine. It identified as a TEAC USB Floppy drive, and when plugged in it simply had the drive light turn on and continuously seek for data. It worked perfectly in my Windows 7 machine, and was very fast and smooth. The support representative was not aware of any issue that would prevent it from working on my machine, and it does work on other people's Windows 10 machines. If I hadn't needed it working on my Windows 10 machine as well, I would have kept this one in a heartbeat. From other reviews, it appears that it works on other people's Windows 10 machines, so I'd recommend you at least try it.

The last two devices were both from Chuanganzhuo.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-5-34-USB-External-Floppy-Disk-Drive-Portable-1-44-MB-FDD-for-PC-Windows-2000-XP-Vista-7-8-10-for-Mac-No-Extra-Driver-Required-Plug-and-Play-Black/dp/B00RXEWOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3.5"" USB External Floppy Disk Drive Portable 1.44 MB FDD for PC Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10,for Mac,No Extra Driver Required,Plug and Play,Black</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-5-34-USB-External-Floppy-Disk-Drive-Portable-1-44-MB-FDD-for-PC-Windows-2000-XP-Vista-Windows-7-8-10-Dustproof-Scratch-Resistant-External-Bag-Case-No-External-Driver-Plug-and-Play/dp/B00WSW1YXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3.5"" USB External Floppy Disk Drive Portable 1.44 MB FDD for PC Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7/8/10 +Dustproof Scratch-Resistant External Bag Case,No External Driver,Plug and Play</a>. Both devices worked fine on Windows 7 Pro, but on Windows 10 Home they immediately had the drive light up and started a very loud seek process that never finished. These devices were louder than any other drive I tested, but did work just fine under Windows 7. Both used the TEAC USB Floppy driver as well.

My conclusion: If you are lucky enough to be one of those whose computers will use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrent-External-USB-1-44-MB-2x-Floppy-Disk-Drive-FL-UDRV/dp/B00E9MD700/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV)</a>, get that drive.

  I needed a way to transfer music that I've written and performed from my KR-15 Intelligent Piano (Roland) to my Windows 7 computer.  The KR-15 only saves to a floppy disk, not a CD or a flash drive.  The computer does not have a floppy disk drive, only a CD drive.  So I was very happy to find your floppy disk drive on-line;  no retail store nearby sold them.  Your floppy drive arrive on-time and worked beautifully.  So now I can use a very fine instrument to record and save my music on my computer.

The drive was absolutely 'plug 'n play'; no issues at all in setup.

The disk was, fortunately, still viable and the drive read it first try.

The drive is light, comes with the required cable, with excellent fit and finish.  As noted in the instructions, the drive is best powered by an internal-to-the computer USB port; some external USB ports may not offer the power required to run the drive.  It's rare these days that I get requests to read one of the old 3.5"" disks, but this drive is going into my road kit - if needed it will save me a trip back to the shop to fire up a machine with an internal floppy drive.

Also I say unfortunately because this is the first item I have ever had to return to anyone, online or local. When purchasing this Disk Drive I had gone strictly by the label ""Best Seller"" and the high number of positive reviews along with the exceptional rating. I will be much more careful with future orders. I appreciate the ability to easily return an item but regret having to do so.

FIRST REVIEW: I have had this Portable Disk Drive for two days now. I have tried to get it to work time and time again......but it refuses. I plugged the USB into my desktop and laptop. Both computers indicate it is connected but keeps giving me the message to insert a floppy diskette even though there was one already loaded. The drive seems to be reading the disk but unfortunately would not open it to the files. All I wanted to do was rescue old photographs on the diskettes by transferring them to a CD.

Instructions were very vague for this device. It does indicate this is for ""legacy floppy discs"" and when I Googled the term I found this statement, ""Native legacy devices are not supported by most modern software applications."" If this is the case then I would suspect it is a worthless device for most all newer computers.

I will keep doing research just in case I am not doing something right. If I can get it to work I will return and change my review. All I can say right now it if your intentions for this device is the same as mine.... don't waste your money and time on this product until you get more information from the company! I will read the description here in case I missed something.","3.5&quot; usb external floppy disk drive portable 1.44 mb fdd pc windows 2000/xp/vista/7/8/10 mac,no extra driver required,plug play,black",Chuanganzhuo

Like other reviews said, I needed to put in a disk, wait a little while, and then prayed that it worked. I copied the available files onto my hard drive. Then needed to eject the disk, disconnect the USB completely, plug it back in and try the next disk. Some disks worked; some did not. I kept ejecting and disconnecting, and then it worked. And sometimes it completely crashed the computer. I couldn't force quit either, but I needed to hold down the power button to completely do a hard reboot. I'm very disappointed. The price was not too out of range or I would send it back. But what's the alternative?
**UPDATE** a couple of weeks later:  I tried this again on an older Mac, OS X Snow Leopard, 10.6.8, and I had much better results so I upgraded the star rating. I still needed to disconnect the USB and reconnect after each floppy, but at least I did not get any computer freezes. I now can recover info from some old disks. Some still did not work, and those I think the disks may have been damaged by humidity maybe.

If you get the ""Format this drive"" error like many of you are getting, that's caused by the floppy discs being either corrupted or just past the shelf life. The physical drives inside the plastic cases have a shelf life of like 10 years. We are almost 20 years past 3.5'' floppy disc technology so go into this expecting that many of your discs won't work. Also, certain brands last longer than others. Remember how in the 90's some floppy discs were like a few dollars extra? Yeah those are the ones that will still work, the cheap discs are the first to go, specifically the HP grey ones. The discs that came out in the late 90's to early 00's are the ones that should still work. Something I've found is that if you had custom documents or you custom formatted the disc, they probably won't work. The pre-formatted discs are ones that worked the best.

2645,3.0,"04 25, 2015",A2D7ZXRASBD9HX,B00RXEWOAA,"As others have said, this product has ""issues"".  My experience is similar to others:  manual says there's a disc enclosed that isn't there, and the operation of the drive isn't what one would expect.  I plugged the drive into a USB 2 port, and the computer recognized it, and said it was ready to use immediately.(Windows 7 OS.) In my case, after playing with it, I figured out how I need to use it:  After putting a floppy in, the menu of what was on the disc came up, and I was able to download the info from it.  However, after ejecting the floppy, the next floppy that was inserted was not recognized, and the drive ran on and on and on, as if searching for something.  I finally stopped it by ejecting the disc, after which the drive asked for a disc to be inserted.  I did so, with the same results.  So, I unplugged the drive, then plugged it back in, and inserted a disc.  It came up fine, and I downloaded the info, after which I inserted another disc, with the same results as previously.  SO, I now unplug the drive from the USB port after each disc is read, eject the disc, plug the drive back in, insert the next disc, and read/download the info from that disc; then repeat.  I've downloaded info/pictures from about two dozen discs, and the drive appears to be working well using my scenario.  I haven't tried to write to a disc, as that's not of interest/need.  For the price, it's worth fooling with the drive to get the info/pictures off of the floppies, after which I'll put it in a drawer and forget about it.","3.5&quot; usb external floppy disk drive portable 1.44 mb fdd pc windows 2000/xp/vista/7/8/10 mac,no extra driver required,plug play,black",Chuanganzhuo

The product appeared to be very good quality and well constructed. Installation was a snap. I used a 3.5"" to 5.25""  adapter (not included) to install the USB drive into my PC.  Since I am running Windows 10, Windows recognized the card and installed the appropriate drivers. The enclosed mini-CD included drivers, which will need to be used on a system running Windows 7/Vista/XP. It may be confusing to some users because the CD contains three sets of drivers: One for ASMedia USB card; one for Renesas; and one for VIA. Perhaps the seller has more than one version of this card with different chip, or perhaps the disc contains drivers for other products as well,  but Windows recognized this card as a Renesas chip. The Renesas driver folder (which is names ""D720201-202"" on the CD) not only contains the drivers but also very clear installation instructions for any that may need it. The USB3 cable from the 3.5"" drive connects to the PCIe card, but you will need a USB 2.0 port either on the motherboard or a separate expansion card for the front USB ports to function. Since most motherboards today come with an ample supply of on-board USB ports (I had one extra unused one) this should not be an issue for most users. I tested all 6 ports (2 on the card and 4 on the drive) and they all functioned well. I used a PNY 32 GB USB 3 flash drive to test the speed of the USB 3 ports and got 120 MB/s read and 50 MB write speeds with this stick. Results of course will depend on the specific USB flash drive one uses, but it was clearly faster than the same flash drive in a USB 2 port. Only one minor sticking point : I could not boot from a bootable flash drive from either of the USB 3 ports, which means one could also not boot from an attached external Hard drive attached via one of the USB 3 ports. This is likely a BIOS issue with my specific installation. My BIOS (Asus PF motherboard) allows me to boot from any USB port that is on the motherboard, but apparently not any add-on boards (or at least not this one). This was not a big deal for me. I used this card mainly to upgrade an older secondary PC (about 8 years old) to USB 3 capability for faster transfer of file to and from the PC. All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone wishing to expand or upgrade an older PC to have USB 3 capability. The price also seems very reasonable and a good value.",sunshine-tipway super speed 3.5 inch floppy disk bay front panel port for computer case [20 pin and 9 pin connector] + pci-e 2 port usb 3.0 express card with 5v 4-pin power connector,Sunshine-tipway

I bought this because looks the only product available on Amazon with 6 USB ports WITH USB 3.0 even if have only 3 stars I given a chance.

Don't know if ""STW"" used random stuff from different companies due the included mini CD Rom have 3 folders for different USB PCIe cards (each piece of this product may have different HW) or sells different products with the same Mini CD.

So, what I've done is the following:
>mounted the front dock in the floppy bay
>mounted the PCIe Card in the PCIe Slot
>plugged the USB 2.0 plug on the MoBo's USB port
>plugged the USB 3.0 cable on the USB3 PCIe card
>plugged the P.S. MOLEX cable to the USB3 PCIe card
>turned on the PC (a Dell Studio 540 with Windows 7 Home Premium x64)
>inserted the Mini CD

At this point windows fail to find the right drivers automatically on WU, so:

>go to ""Device Manager""
>select the unknown device
>search for driver (manually)
>select the CD drive and let it search

In my case windows found and installed a driver from NEC folder so I went there and manually installed the full package running ""setup.exe"" from ""RENESAS-USB3-Host-Driver-30230-Setup-x86-x64-Binary"" folder.
After that I got 2 devices named ""Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 HOST Controller"" and ""Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 HOST HUB"".

Everything worked fine.
Tested copying 350MB on a 64GB Sandisk Ultra Flash Drive 3.0
On USB 2.0 ports go at 16~MB/s
On USB 3.0 ports go at 50~MB/s

I got exactly what I needed- just as pictured by the Seller. The floppy drive works great- just plug the USB in and it works- no programs or drivers needed to download. That's very nice!

The floppy disk slides in, and it is secure. The push button for the floppy release feels secure. This product is well made. And considering that using floppy drives is a rare thing these days- finding this brand new quality one for the price and prompt delivery is a great thing.

Sometimes ones has to go retro for innovative ideas. I was in the market for a Floppy drive to save images for my electronics projects on equipment that does not have USB stick options. I have an older oscilloscope that has a floppy disk drive. I needed to save waveform images and then use them on my PC that does not have a floppy drive.

The device is true plug-and-play... plugs into a USB socket and requires no extra software installation to use.  My only complaint about it is that when you eject a disk, the entire device goes away in Windows Explorer and does not automatically come back when another disk is inserted.  Thus, changing disks requires extra steps in order to make the new contents visible, which is inconvenient; but that's a small price to pay compared to, say, not being able to retrieve your old data at all because it's stored on an outdated medium.  Right?  Data access is slower with this drive also (compared to an internal drive), but that's to be expected given that it goes through a serial port (USB) versus an internal parallel bus.

Unfortunately computers now a days no longer come with any floppy drive.

Overall this particular floppy disk drive is very simple in design and pretty decently made overall. The USB cable is quite thick and the shell of the base is made out of a thick plastic material...both of which come across as very sturdy and durable. On the front of the device, you have your floppy disk slot, an indication light, and an ejector button.

This particular floppy disk drive is also very easy to use, as it is completely plug and play. That means that there is no need to download and install any drivers or any other programs...just plug it into your computer, slide a floppy disk into the front slot, and you are able to copy files onto and off of your computer.

Note: I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and this IS my honest and unbiased thoughts on this product. Now you may be thinking to yourself ""Suuure it is...there is no way that this jerk is not at least a little bit full of BS. Anyone else would have at least a slight amount of bias in his particular situation."" And you would usually be correct about the latter, but I can tell you that I am not just anyone. I am a man who has way too much time on their hands and who cares far too much about what random people on the internet think about his opinions. Some say that the ability to leave honest reviews is a blessing, but I know for a fact that it is a curse.",esynic usb floppy drive 3.5&quot; usb external floppy disk drive portable 1.44 mb fdd usb drive plug and play for pc windows 10 7 8 windows xp vista mac black,eSynic

This unit works fine; I can confirm it reads and writes both 1.44 MB and 720 kB. It detects as a Teac mechanism, for those that care. Legacy users take note -- while this drive will read and write 720 kB disks, it will NOT format them. (This is a common issue with modern USB drives... unfortunately, you'll probably need a ""real"" one if you need that functionality.) 5-star product and 5-star service. Thanks!

EDIT: Amazingly, the seller reached out to me and offered to send me a replacement no charge. That's never happened before on Amazon. I'm changing my review to 3 stars, and will further revise as necessary when the new unit comes in.

OP: I read good things about this model drive. I have a USB floppy which works, but only reads/writes 1.44 MB disks. I have an older PC I'm trying to exchange 720k floppies with, and this drive advertises that compatibility.

Unit was recognized by Windows when I plugged in the USB, but that's about all the good I can say. The drive would not read any floppy, including known-good ones tested in other drives. Wouldn't write a floppy either, so it wasn't just a case of mis-aligned heads. Now, it may be mine was damaged in shipping (it was fulfilled by Amazon; the package was loosely packed and had been jostled a lot), but the box it came in was not compromised in any way.

2738,3.0,"05 18, 2018",A2V0YBZ3X61VRP,B01GHF5VS2,"I'm a little disappointed with this external drive just because it says it works with Windows 10 and it absolutely does not.  Most of our computers have Windows 10 now, even some of our older computers... but none of them would acknowledge this external drive.  Not TOO surprising since this technology itself is so old... but I was able to get it to work with a 13 year old laptop.  I've upgraded the laptop to Windows 7, but I think the laptop itself is old enough to be able to use the external drive.  Once I got it working, it was SUPER slow.  I would say that it was probably the disks, but it would read the disk, then freeze and stop responding, then reload the entire disk again... and that tells me it's the drive.  It happened over and over each disk I put in.  I stopped chancing checking what was on the disks and just started copying them off immediately in hopes to get through it faster.  I actually have an old computer with a 3.5"" floppy drive and I think it would have been faster to get that up and running than using this drive.

So, point to the story?  Most computers that run Windows 10 probably won't be able to easily use this drive.  I'm not sure I would chance it unless you have an older computer/laptop that was around when 3.5"" floppy disks were used.

Update 4/20/18: No, I'm not high. I got an email from the company asking how if I was satisfied with my order some time after I had the drive. I posted my original message above, but this was several months after I had received it. It was inexpensive, so I kind of left it on the shelf and was going to order another one from another company. The company, seeing my post, asked if they could send another one to me, and update my review. I got it today, this morning, and opened the package, and yep! It works flawlessly. I'm copying my archive of photos from the 3.25-inch floppies (imagine that! Digital photos from waaay back in 1998, when I had a Sony Mavica, which I got as a wedding present from my brother) to my Mac hard drive now. I'd order it again from this company. I would have given the drive 4 stars for the drive itself, since the first one was dead, but they get the full 5 for being responsive.

I purchased this after reading some of the other reviews.  I tried to install this on a Windows 10 Pro 64-bit desktop.  The system seemed to recognize a new device but would not access it.  After trying several different diskettes, I gave up and shut down my PC.  The next time I turned on my desktop, I got a blue screen of death.  Restarting, I was able to interrupt Windows Startup and try a recovery.  However, the system would not recognize my USB mouse.  Fortunately, I stumbled on some of the Windows system menus that I could access by keyboard commands.  I was able to restore from a previous restore point but still had the blue screen.  Finally, after much online research (using another computer) and trial and error, I changed a registry setting one of the articles mentioned and was finally able to get my desktop working again.  Total time, about 4 hours but I was sweating bullets most of the time.  Later, I tried installing this on an old XP laptop that I didn't care about but still no go.

2781,5.0,"11 29, 2017",A11GBDVXJSTXSX,B01GHF5VS2,"I was trying to recover data from floppies to my Windows 10 Home machine. I ended up trying five different devices and am posting my review to let you know my results.
First, all five devices worked PERFECTLY on my Windows 7 Pro laptop. However, when plugging in to my Windows 10 machine, three of them would only sit and spin with the drive light on, even though they were recognized as drives by Win10.

After a little looking, I found that the devices that worked on my Windows 10 machine identified themselves and used the driver for the Y-E Data USB floppy, while the devices that just sat and spun identified themselves and used the driver for a TEAC floppy drive. So there must be a little difference in the internal configuration of the drive that is causing the issue.

I tried 5 devices and found that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tendak-USB-Floppy-Disk-Drive/dp/B01NCV01GY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tendak USB Floppy Disk Drive</a>&nbsp;worked perfectly, as did the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Esynic-USB-Floppy-Drive/dp/B01GHF5VS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Esynic USB Floppy Drive </a>. Both identified as Y-E Data USB floppy drives. When they were plugged in, they worked smoothly and quietly. It was a toss-up which one to choose to keep, but I eventually went with the Tendak because it seemed slightly quieter and faster, but that was really subjective. The Tendak also had more information such as a warranty card and information on how to contact support, while the Esynic box was empty. As far as quality of the drive, they seemed identical. If I had needed more than one drive, I would have kept them both.

For me, initially the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sabrent-External-USB-1-44-MB-2x-Floppy-Disk-Drive-FL-UDRV/dp/B00E9MD700/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive (FL-UDRV)</a>&nbsp;seemed the nicest. The box was glossy with information covering it, you'd expect to see this sitting on a shelf in a big box store. (All other drives came in plain brown boxes). There were touches of quality in how the drive was packed, the box was made to fit it with a area for the cable to fit in and a dust cover over the USB end to keep it clean. It came with a beautiful guide to using the floppy, including information like the write-protect switch and not removing a floppy while the drive light is on, that newer users would not be familiar with. They also had a support phone number, and the person who answered seemed to be an American. Unfortunately, this was one of the devices that would not work on my Windows 10 machine. It identified as a TEAC USB Floppy drive, and when plugged in it simply had the drive light turn on and continuously seek for data. It worked perfectly in my Windows 7 machine, and was very fast and smooth. If I hadn't needed it working on Windows 10 as well, I would have kept this one in a heartbeat. From other reviews, it appears that it works on other people's Windows 10 machines, so I'd recommend you at least try it.

The last two devices were both from Chuanganzhuo.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-5-34-USB-External-Floppy-Disk-Drive-Portable-1-44-MB-FDD-for-PC-Windows-2000-XP-Vista-7-8-10-for-Mac-No-Extra-Driver-Required-Plug-and-Play-Black/dp/B00RXEWOAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3.5"" USB External Floppy Disk Drive Portable 1.44 MB FDD for PC Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7/8/10,for Mac,No Extra Driver Required,Plug and Play,Black</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-5-34-USB-External-Floppy-Disk-Drive-Portable-1-44-MB-FDD-for-PC-Windows-2000-XP-Vista-Windows-7-8-10-Dustproof-Scratch-Resistant-External-Bag-Case-No-External-Driver-Plug-and-Play/dp/B00WSW1YXA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3.5"" USB External Floppy Disk Drive Portable 1.44 MB FDD for PC Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7/8/10 +Dustproof Scratch-Resistant External Bag Case,No External Driver,Plug and Play</a>. Both devices worked fine on Windows 7 Pro, but on Windows 10 Home they immediately had the drive light up and started a very loud seek process that never finished. These devices were louder than any other drive I tested, but did work just fine under Windows 7. Both used the TEAC USB Floppy driver as well.

******************************************************
I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars.
Please see my changes after this first part.
******************************************************
This drive does not work on latest version of Windows 10. (Ver. 1607, Build 14393.693.)
Maybe those who have it working have an earlier version. (??)
I have 3  PC's running this version and this drive does not work on any of them.
It did work on my old Windows XP laptop, but I wanted to use my Win 10 systems.
I tried using the driver from XP on Win 10 system but that didn't work.
I wonder if any external usb floppy will work with Win 10.
MS has no drivers for them.

I am returning my drive.

REVISED REVIEW:
When I returned the drive , my purchase was immediately refunded by Amazon.
Also I received messages from the seller advising they would be sending me a replacement.
Also they wrote about how to install and use the device.
They did send a replacement unit.
It is working just fine. When plugged in, the drive appears in My Computer > Devices and Drives.
I have been able to read from my old floppy disks and I can write to them also.

So I called up TDK and they offered to help replace the floppy disks but I asked about the images of my grandfather that were on them. This is were TDK shows how great of a company they are.

2928,2.0,"11 10, 2014",AWFXQY7BO3V0W,B00EPFGVWM,"I got it working, but it is pretty much a disappointment.

1) no documentation on how to hook it up.  Still looking for a clear description.  A PDF to download from the web would be fine, but I can not find any.
2) blue 3.0 usb cable is too short to make it to the back panel plugs, so I had to buy an extender and wait another week to get it all working.
3) power connector is flimsy and would self destruct usually on plugging in, but if you push it right you can get the two power connections to be made
4) Apparently the motherboard USB is for the memory cards, while the USB cable is for the USB plugs on the front ... I don't know this for sure, but I didn't plug the motherboard cable in, and the memory ports don't work.
5) USB sockets are mounted upside down: you can see it in the picture if you look carefully.  USB devices that have a ""top"" have to be plugged in upside down so you see the bottom.  Not a big problem, but it adds to unnecessary fumbling when plugging things in.
6) memory sockets are upside down.  Again, an SD card has printing on the ""front"" and that is inserted facing down which again creates unnecessary fumbling when.
7) Someone else mentioned difficulty getting it to fit, and I also had difficulty getting it to slide into the 3.5 inch bay,

2931,2.0,"03 29, 2014",A332PPFJQLY0HY,B00EPFGVWM,"First things first, this one is better than other awful front panels.
Actually it is 3.0, by the performance I've got on my 3.0 pendrives, on the 3.0 ports (over 100MB/s depending on pendrive model)
I would define this as a hybrid 2.0 and 3.0 front panel.
Then comes the caveats.

1)
With this plugged in, my computer won't even turn on. Wait a second, I had to troubleshoot. I begun by unpluggin everything and plugging just the USB 3.0 cable. PC Turned on and worked fine, windows installed as hub. Then I plugged the memory card USB connector (the black rectangle one). Computer worked perfectly fine. Memory reader works. Then I plugged the power molex connector the power supply. My computer won't even turn on. So there's the drama. I have it installed right now, it works without the power section connected. Weird.

2)Due to point 1, I cannot plug high energy demanding hard drives.

3)The USB 3.0 cable is so short in length, that I had to buy this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E9IFDBU/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15

4)The 4th USB 3.0 port suddenly stopped working. It just doesn't work anymore.

5)The front bezel didn't fit the sides of my case's 3 1/2 bay. It bended like an arc. Funny enough, but not sure if its my case fault.

If anyone knows a similar product that actually works and cost similarly please let me know. For now, I'm leaving this installed in my computer because I tried other two different readers and one didn't work and the other was too old with just one USB 2.0",agptek&reg; 3.5&quot; front panel 4 ports usb 3.0 hub &amp; 6 slot card reader port perfect for pc floppy disk position,AGPtek
